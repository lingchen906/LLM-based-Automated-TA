# Learning Opinion Mining in E-Learning Platforms: An LLM-based Automated Thematic Analysis Approach

### Overview
  This study presents a fully automated thematic analysis framework that combines k-means clustering with locally deployable LLMs to conduct qualitative coding securely and effectively, minimizing human intervention while maintaining interpretability and reliability. Our findings indicate that themes generated using this framework not only capture the key structures of human-coded themes but also achieve higher rater agreement. In addition, the results demonstrate that inter-LLM agreement serves as a strong predictor of alignment with human-coded themes, providing a scalable and efficient approach to theme evaluation. Compared to traditional methods, this framework significantly accelerates theme extraction while reducing manual workload and addressing privacy concerns with cloud-based AI services, making it particularly useful in real-time content analysis and large-scale text analytics. 

### Proposed Framework

  This 3-stage workflow draws on Braun and Clarke (2006) six-phase framework for thematic analysis, adapting its principles for automation through LLMs and clustering techniques. Stage 1 aligns with the familiarization and coding phases by using human-provided examples in prompt design to guide initial code generation, followed by bootstrapped sampling with Gemma 2 27B model to assign codes. In Stage 2, corresponding to the search for themes and review phases, sentence embeddings systematically refine and reassign codes, mimicking human-driven thematic refinement. Stage 3 parallels the defining and naming themes phase, where clustering groups refined codes into broader themes, and Gemma 2 27B model synthesizes these into meaningful names. Finally, the reporting phase is operationalized through inter-LLM agreement (using Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3 8B model) to assess theme consistency, ensuring that the generated themes capture distinct and stable patterns in the data.
