# Learning Opinion Mining in E-Learning Platforms: An LLM-based Automated Thematic Analysis Approach

### Overview
  This study presents a fully automated thematic analysis framework that combines k-means clustering with locally deployable LLMs to conduct qualitative coding securely and effectively, minimizing human intervention while maintaining interpretability and reliability. Our findings indicate that themes generated using this framework not only capture the key structures of human-coded themes but also achieve higher rater agreement. In addition, the results demonstrate that inter-LLM agreement serves as a strong predictor of alignment with human-coded themes, providing a scalable and efficient approach to theme evaluation. Compared to traditional methods, this framework significantly accelerates theme extraction while reducing manual workload and addressing privacy concerns with cloud-based AI services, making it particularly useful in real-time content analysis and large-scale text analytics. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4e4cb5a-fece-4c6e-aa5e-246da5ec52df)
